This project comes with template of MVC (Model, View, and Controller):

- **Model**
  - Directly interacts with the database and passes it to the controller.
- **View**
  - Only receives data from the controller and displays in the user-interface.
- **Controller**
  - Handles the flow of logic data, acts as a bridge between the model and view.
